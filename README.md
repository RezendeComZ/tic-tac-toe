# Tic Tac Toe

A vanilla javascript Tic-tac-toe game with bootstrap.

I wrote this simple game from scratch to test and see if it was possible to make a game with my current javascript knowledge.
It works!
There could be fewer lines of code adding more functions in some places, but the idea was to see if it was possible. So maybe Iâ€™ll simplify in the future.

CPU player!
Playing against the CPU is available when you type "cpu" in Player B's field or leave it blank.
It is technically impossible to beat the CPU. But if you can, report it, is a bug! ðŸ˜„
